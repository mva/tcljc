### Differences to `tclj-in-tclj`

* No column numbers.  Column numbers are tracked by Clojure, but do
  not show up anywhere.  tclj error messages print both line and
  column values, but I can't remember whether a column number was
  helpful for me ever.  So do not compute, store, or report column
  numbers and see how this turns out.
